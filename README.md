# Wildfire Visualizer

This interactive map depicts wildfires over 1,000 acres in the U.S. from 1992 to 2020, using National Forest Service wildfire incidence data and various government geo data layers.
I used D3.js to build the web map, and Pandas/Python scripts to clean and process the data before analysis.

Visit the interactive [here](https://trominoes.github.io/wildfire-visualizer/graph.html) to see more details.

## Structure
Landing page is at `index.html`, while the map is at `graph.html`. CSV/JSON geo data, css files, and js files are in the `static` folder.
