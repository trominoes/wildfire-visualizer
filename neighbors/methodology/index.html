      <p class="method-desc">“Neighbors” is a word associations game, designed and realized in December 2024. It’s my
        second website-from-scratch, and an exploration of the foundational layer of modern LLM’s. View the source code
        <a href="https://github.com/trominoes/trominoes.github.io">here.</a>
      </p>
      <h3 class="method-heading">About GloVe</h3>
      <p class="method-desc">From the start, I used GloVe to develop the word lists and vocabulary behind “Neighbors.”
        GloVe stands for <a href="https://nlp.stanford.edu/projects/glove/">Global Vectors for Word Representation</a>, and was created by Jeffrey Pennington, Richard Socher,
        and Christopher D. Manning in 2014. At its core, GloVe is an unsupervised learning algorithm that computes
        vector representations of words, based on each word’s probability of co-occurrence with other words in a given
        training corpus. </p>
      <p class="method-desc">These vector representations contain rich information about words’ similarity and
        relationships to one another. For example, the ‘nearest neighbors’ of a word vector (i.e. vectors with least
        Euclidean distance from the target word) are those which we’d expect to have the most related definitions or
        linguistic uses; they are often synonyms with the target word or appear in the same phrases/contexts. (This
        property of GloVe is ultimately what the game relies upon to depict similar words!)</p>
      <p class="method-desc">Vector representations also reveal ‘linear substructures,’ or a kind of quantified relation
        between word pairs. That is, vector differences can capture verifiable distinctions in meaning:</p>
      <div style="text-align: center;"><img src="https://nlp.stanford.edu/projects/glove/images/man_woman.jpg" class="method-img"></div>
      <p class="method-desc">While the game does not make use of these substructures, I think it’s a fascinating feature
        of GloVe worth further inspection.</p>
      <p class="method-desc">In “Neighbors,” I utilized the pre-trained, 400,000-word dataset from Wikipedia 2014 and
        Gigaword 5. Future extensions of this game might involve deriving new vector representations of words based on a
        different/updated corpus of my choosing!</p>
      <h3 class="method-heading">Word validation</h3>
      <p class="method-desc">Though GloVe’s 400k-word dataset provided a good baseline, I found that not all words would
        be suitable for a game. Within the pre-trained model, there are fragments, like <span class="method-bold">(</span>, <span class="method-bold">‘nt</span>, and <span class="method-bold">’re</span>. There are
        obscure and esoteric names, like <span class="method-bold">Chernyakhov</span> and <span class="method-bold">Zhiqing</span>. Last, there are words that are just a little boring,
        like <span class="method-bold">there</span>, <span class="method-bold">two</span>, and <span class="method-bold">Thursday</span>. </p>
      <p class="method-desc">To improve the list of starting words for “Neighbors,” I selected a range of words that
        would feel familiar but not extremely common. (By order of frequency, this was the 2500th to the 4500th word.)
        Then, each word was validated such that it had to contain only alphabetic characters, be greater than three
        characters long, and not be a common proper noun like a first name or country. I also manually sorted through
        the list to block words that might lead to problematic content. A total of 1530 start words were passed.</p>
      <p class="method-desc">Next, I selected a range of words that would serve as the total vocabulary of the game, and
        might be shown as neighboring words to the player. (This was roughly the top 10,000 words in the dataset, by
        frequency.) For each word, I found its six nearest valid neighbors, which were required to contain only
        alphabetic characters, and not be a simple variation of the target word (e.g. attaching or removing an ‘-s’ to
        pluralize.) Then, the target word and list of six valid neighbors were passed as a key-value pair into a
        dictionary/map. All vector information was stripped from the variables.</p>
      <p class="method-desc">Finally, my Python program exported the starting word list and neighbors dictionary/map as
        JSON’s, for the website’s use.</p>
      <h3 class="method-heading">Randomization</h3>
      <p class="method-desc">Like similar online word games (see below for inspirations), I wanted “Neighbors” to follow
        a randomized daily puzzle format. But because this GitHub page is hosted statically, daily start words and
        solutions cannot be sent server-side and must be generated dynamically from the browser. </p>
      <p class="method-desc">To ensure that all devices would receive the same puzzle on the same day, I used a series
        of date-based hashes and a seeded Pseudo-Random Number Generator (PRNG). </p>
      <p class="method-desc">Selection of the start word must be randomized, to avoid any day-by-day ordering in
        difficulty. I chose to shuffle the valid word list before export, thereby ‘baking in’ randomness and allowing
        start words to be chosen iteratively. A current date hash computes the number of days since a reference date,
        and passes that value as an index of the list. The start word at that index is selected, which is unique over a
        period of 1530 days.</p>
      <p class="method-desc">Selecting the solution path required multiple iterations of selecting a random neighbor of
        the target word. In this case, I used the cyrb128 hash to first generate a 128-bit random seed from the current
        date, and then seeded the sfc32 PRNG to randomly select neighbors. Both of those functions utilize code from <a
          href="https://stackoverflow.com/questions/521295/seeding-the-random-number-generator-in-javascript">this Stack
          Overflow response.</a></p>
      <p class="method-desc">Thanks Internet!</p>
      <h3 class="method-heading">The hex grid</h3>
      <p class="method-desc">My original prototype of “Neighbors” in Python and MatPlotLib used Principal Component
        Analysis (PCA), a data analysis and visualization technique, to reduce the dataset’s high-dimensional vectors to
        two dimensions. Target words and their neighbors were then depicted in 2D space, with target words centered at
        the origin and neighbors’ positions being defined by their vector difference and distance.</p>
      <p class="method-desc">However, I eventually discarded this approach in favor of cleanliness and playability. The
        player loses some information about words’ relationships, but neighbors do not collide with each other on
        screen, and the game is better suited for small screen devices. Instead of PCA, a target words’ neighbors are
        represented an equal distance away in uniform hexagonal cells.</p>
      <p class="method-desc">This design is a familiar one to many word game players (see below), but also innovates
        with its much larger grid system. Because I wanted cells and neighbors to be revealed along the player’s search
        path, I needed to build a CSS Grid that was wide and tall enough to accommodate six-move search paths in any
        direction. My solution was a roughly 13-by-13 grid of hex cells, with the puzzle’s start word located at the
        center. </p>
      <p class="method-desc">On click of a neighbor word, I designed Javascript functions to pull new neighbors from the
        dictionary/map JSON, populate new hex cells, and check for a game win or loss. I also wrote a grid-centering
        function to re-center the hex grid around the current target word.</p>
      <h3 class="method-heading">Inspirations</h3>
      <p class="method-desc">If you’ve made it this far, thanks for reading! Please start a conversation with me if you
        have any questions about anything I’ve written here. </p>
      <p class="method-desc">Before I go, I’d like to acknowledge/admire some key inspirations, without which this game
        would not otherwise exist. NYT’s Spelling Bee and spellbee.org, which heavily influenced the UI and general
        appearance of this site. Wordle, which convinced me that I could build it all myself. And GamePigeon’s word
        hunt. I love word hunt.</p>
