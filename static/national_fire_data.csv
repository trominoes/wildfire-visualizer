1992,67961,2199923,32.4,"The 1992 fire season came on the heels of a major policy review by the U.S. Forest Service. After decades of total suppression led to a build-up of fuel, firefighters began to utilize controlled and prescribed burns to reduce the risk of future megafires from breaking out. 

One major fire that occurred in 1992 was the Fountain Fire in California’s Shasta County, which threatened both forest lands and rural communities settled in the area. At the time, the Fountain Fire was among the most destructive wildfires in the state’s recorded history; however, it no longer ranks in the top 20 today."
1993,61975,2191587,35.4,
1994,75932,4115582,54.2,"Close to home, the Tyee Creek fire complex burned for 33 days and over 140,000 acres in 1994 before finally being contained. The fire was largely started by July lightning storms and was compounded by a buildup of brush on the forest floor, resulting in one of Washington’s largest fires in the twentieth century. 

Similar fires and the deaths of 34 firefighters in 1994 led to further questioning of the Forest Service’s policy of total fire suppression."
1995,71440,2049553,28.7,"Across regions, the U.S. experienced a relatively mild fire season. On the West Coast, a wet winter and lack of lightning storms allowed a respite for firefighters and opportunities to pursue more prescribed burning."
1996,75561,6004833,79.5,"In 1996, Doug Erskine, Fire Director of the National Park Service, released a statement in support of expanded fire use in national forests. Congress agreed to fund the operations of new prescribed natural fire teams, and fire specialists developed software to assess risk and predict fire spread. Erskine endorsed the idea that “wildland fire, as a critical natural process, must be reintroduced into the ecosystem.”"

1998,68356,2015942,29.5,
1999,89350,6136947,68.7,"Hundreds of thousands of grass and scrubland acres burned in Nevada, threatening ranches and interstate roads. A precipitation deficit in July led to an abundance of dry fuel, while dry thunderstorms and other natural causes ultimately resulted in 70% of the state’s wildfires."

2003,68275,4511189,66.1,
2004,69370,8248571,118.9,"By total acres burned, the 2004 fire season was the worst on record in the state of Alaska. A dry August and frequent lightning strikes led to over 6.6 million acres of forest destroyed. Further, due to the high amount of carbon stored in Alaska’s vulnerable permafrost and topsoil, forest fires in Alaska release significantly higher carbon emissions compared to fires in other states."
2005,92921,9710849,104.5,
2006,117943,10082825,85.5,"For the first time in official recorded data, over 10 million acres of the United States burned in a single year."
2007,98837,9281711,93.9,"In 2007, Idaho experienced uncharacteristically large fires with high costs. Drought conditions preceded a season that continued into September, with grasslands particularly affected by the burning."

2010,85579,3526451,41.2,
2011,98903,9673820,97.8,"Strong winds and drought, brought on by La Niña weather, contributed to a catastrophic fire season in the southern U.S. In the state of Texas, nearly 3,000 homes were lost over the course of the summer, with upwards of $500 million in damages and six fatalities. Texas fires further accounted for about half of all acres burned in 2011."
2012,74258,9448555,127.2,"2012 became the warmest year on record in the contiguous U.S. since 1895. While the total number of fires did not greatly increase because of the heightened heat and dryness, blazes became more intense—the year’s 127.2-acre average set a new national record for mean fire size. Many megafires, such as Holloway and Long Draw, occurred in the Rockies region."
2013,66434,4494424,67.7,
2014,70480,3676997,52.2,
2015,77275,10226169,132.3,"The U.S. once again surpassed 10 million acres burned in 2015, with over 1 million acres able to be attributed to blazes in Washington state alone. Summer months saw homes in Wenatchee destroyed, and the Puget Sound blanketed by forest fire smoke. In total, the 2015 fire season represented the largest ever in Washington’s history; Alaska and Oregon experienced similarly busy seasons."
2016,81993,5362282,65.4,
2017,82279,10245663,124.5,"In Florida, a state not known for its fire seasons, a mix of both natural events and human activity caused massive blazes and mass evacuations. Elsewhere in the country, extended drought contributed to ever-expanding disasters."
2018,80860,8243602,101.9,"As part of the Mendocino Complex, California’s Ranch Fire became the largest wildfire in state history until it was surpassed in 2020. It was fully contained by mid-September, but hotspots within continued to burn until as late as November 7. Meanwhile, the Camp Fire was widely publicized as California’s deadliest fire ever, with $16.5 billion in damages and 85 civilians killed. 

These fires signified the extensive dangers posed by fires in the modern ‘wildland urban interface.’ As border communities develop and intermingle with the environment, they become increasingly vulnerable to natural disaster."
2019,63557,4915668,77.3,
2020,73262,10495382,143.3,"2020 was a record-breaking year, for all the wrong reasons. Huge blazes in California contributed to the state’s largest wildfire year in recorded history, as well as the nation’s new highs in total area burned and average fire size.

Scientific consensus demonstrates that while significant burn acreage was not uncommon to pre-settlement California, factors such as climate change, development in fire-prone areas, and aggressive suppression of fire in preceding decades have presented a mounting danger to human lives today. Solutions to this problem exist, but true progress cannot occur without a paradigm shift in how Americans perceive and prevent fires of the future."
